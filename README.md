Job Salary Prediction using NLP

[Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/job-salary-prediction/data) with all training data, in the repo you can see file named data.csv which is a part of train.csv from kaggle, I decided to keep it in case the competition would be deleted and there will be no more way to get initial files. Also, I made a small part of a file since GitHub allows 100 mb commits to repository. Also implemented importance of words in the way that while some words may boost price, other do not, so what I have done is basically drop every word and take model's output and then compare it with model's output using all words, and after doing such thing for every word we can get the impact of each word.
